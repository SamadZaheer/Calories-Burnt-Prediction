🏋️ Calories Burnt Prediction
This project predicts the calories burnt during exercise based on user activity data. Using machine learning techniques, it leverages exercise and physiological features to build a predictive model that can estimate calories burnt for different workouts.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: To create a regression model that predicts calories burnt from exercise and body-related data.

Dataset:

exercise.csv → contains exercise details (e.g., duration, heart rate, activity type).

calories.csv → contains actual calories burnt values.

Approach:

Data preprocessing and merging datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization.

Feature engineering.

Training regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Model evaluation using standard metrics (R², MAE, RMSE).

📂 Files in the Repository

🚀 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries Used:

numpy, pandas → Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → Machine learning models & evaluation

xgboost → Advanced gradient boosting

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Correlation analysis between features and calories burnt.

Visualized distribution of calories burnt across activities and demographics.

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
Tested multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Compared models using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

👉 Best performance was achieved using XGBoost, providing higher accuracy for calorie prediction.

✅ Future Improvements
Add deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).

Deploy model with Flask/Django as a web app.

Build a real-time calorie prediction dashboard.
