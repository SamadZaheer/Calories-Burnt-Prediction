# Calories Burnt Prediction

This project predicts the **calories burnt during exercise** based on user activity data. Using machine learning techniques, it leverages exercise and physiological features to build a predictive model that can estimate calories burnt during workouts.

## Interpretation & Key Findings

### What the errors mean
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** ≈ average absolute mistake in predicted calories.  
  - Example: MAE ≈ 10 means predictions are off by ~10 calories on average.
- **MSE / RMSE** penalize bigger mistakes more than MAE.  
  - If **RMSE** is much larger than **MAE**, you likely have a few large errors (outliers).
- **R²** = proportion of variance explained (0–1).  
  - Higher is better. R² = 0.95 means the model explains 95% of outcome variance.

### Model-by-model read
- **XGBoost (Test R² ≈ 0.947, MAE ≈ 10.33)**  
  - Best balance of accuracy and stability. Captures non-linear patterns well without overfitting too hard.
- **Random Forest (Test R² ≈ 0.942, MAE ≈ 10.67)**  
  - Very competitive. Note the **train R² ≈ 0.992 vs test R² ≈ 0.942**, which hints at **mild overfitting**.
- **Linear/Ridge/Lasso (Test R² ≈ 0.869–0.870, MAE ≈ 17.99–18.01)**  
  - Linear baselines. Lower accuracy suggests the target has **non-linear** relationships that trees/boosting capture better.

### Practical takeaway
- Use **XGBoost** (current best) for predictions.  
- Keep **Random Forest** as a strong alternative (bagging improves stability), but watch overfitting.  
- **Linear models** are good for interpretability and as sanity checks, but are less accurate here.

## Future Improvements  

- Add deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).  
- Deploy the model with **Flask** or **Django** as a web app.  
- Build a **real-time calorie prediction dashboard** for end users.
